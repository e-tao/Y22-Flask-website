# Y22-GroupProject

Hi teams, for the project to run you need these packages installed.
<ul>
  <li>flask</li>
  <li>SQLAlchemy</li>
  <li>PyMySQL</li>
  <li>mysql-connector</li>
 </ul>

the package managment in Python is pip, so run 
<em>pip install "package name goes here"</em>

please consider create your own<em><strong>yourname-dev-branch</strong></em> working branch, so we can keep the main safe from broken code.
we will merge the working function later.

you can create your dev-branch after pull the main by using

<ul>
  <li>git switch -c yourname-dev-branch</li>
  <li>git checkout -b yourname-dev-branch</li>
</ul>
