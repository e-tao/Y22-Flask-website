# Y22-GroupProject

Hi teams, so far my progress, and you you need these two packages installed to run the app.
install flask
sqlalchemy


please consider create your yourname-dev-branch, and push it to the remote, so we can keep the main safe from broken code.
we will merge the working function later.

you can create your dev-branch after pull the main by using
git switch -c yourname-dev-branch OR
git checkout -b yourname-dev-branch

and push the branch to the remote.
