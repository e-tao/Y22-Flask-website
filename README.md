# Y22-GroupProject

Hi team, there is a requirements.txt file included in the project, which tracks the package dependencies.
In the VSCode terminal run <em>pip install -r requirements.txt</em> to have all dependencies installed.

the package managment in Python is pip, so run 
<em>pip install "package name goes here"</em>

if any new package is installed, please run
<em>pip freeze > requirements.txt</em> to generate new requirements file.

please consider create your own<em><strong>yourname-dev-branch</strong></em> working branch, 
so we can keep the main safe from broken code.
We will ONLY merge the working code to main.

you can create your dev-branch after pull the main by using

<ul>
  <li>git switch -c yourname-dev-branch</li>
  <li>git checkout -b yourname-dev-branch</li>
</ul>
